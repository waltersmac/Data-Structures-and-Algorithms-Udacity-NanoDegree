# Problem_6 Explanation documents
I decided to use a linked list data structure. Within the linked list I created a function to return the list in a python list, I then created the union and intersection functions. The efficency of the algorithm is O(n), this is due to the while loops and for loops that help create the linked list. The space complexity would O(k+n), for both elements when creating the union and intersection.
