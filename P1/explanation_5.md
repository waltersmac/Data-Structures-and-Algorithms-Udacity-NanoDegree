# Problem_5 Explanation documents
I decided to use a linked list data structure as this would help in joining each block in the chain.
The efficency of the algorithm is O(n), this is due to the while loop to go through each block in the chain.
The space complexity would O(n), depending on the number of nodes being created in the linked list.
