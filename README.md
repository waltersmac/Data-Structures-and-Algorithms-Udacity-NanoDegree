# Udacity-Data-Structures-and-Algorithms

### Outline of course:
In this course I am currently learning data structures and algorithms by solving 80+ practice problems. In each course I will begin by learning to solve defined problems related to a particular data structure and algorithm. By the end of each course, I will be able to evaluate and assess different data structures and algorithms for any open-ended problem and implement a solution based on your design choices.
