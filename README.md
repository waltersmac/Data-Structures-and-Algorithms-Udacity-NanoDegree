# Udacity-Data-Structures-and-Algorithms

### Outline of course:
In this course I am currently learning data structures and algorithms by solving 80+ practice problems. In each course I will begin by learning to solve defined problems related to a particular data structure and algorithm. By the end of each course, I will be able to evaluate and assess different data structures and algorithms for any open-ended problem and implement a solution based on your design choices.



#### Introduction
* An overview of your program. 
* Meet your instructors, and refresh my Python skills. 
* Learnt the framework to deconstruct any open-ended problem and then understand the concepts of time and space complexity.

#### P0 - Unscramble computer science problems
Deconstructed a series of open-ended problems into smaller components (e.g, inputs, outputs, series of functions).



#### Data Sctructures
* Learnt different data structures that can be used to store data. 
* Implemented different methods used to manipulate these data structures and examine the efficiency. Understood the advantages and applications of different data structures. 
* Learnt how to approach open ended problems (either in interview or real-world) and select appropriate data structures based on requirements.

#### P1 - Show me the data structures (To be done)
* Solve a series of open-ended practice problems such as LRU Cache, Private Blockchain, File Recursion, and many more. 
* Hone your skills to identify and implement appropriate data structures and corresponding methods which meet the given constraints.



#### Basic Algorithms (To be done)
* Learn and implement basic algorithms such as searching and sorting on different data structures and examine the efficiency of these algorithms. 
* Use recursion to implement these algorithms and then learn how some of these algorithms can be implemented without recursion.
* Practice selecting and modifying these algorithms for a variety of interview problems.

#### P2 - Problems vs. Algorithms (To be done)
* A series of real-world open-ended problems, such as request routing for a web server, search-term auto-completion and Fibonacci heap which train you to apply suitable data structures and algorithms under different contexts.



#### Advanced Algorithms (To be done)
* Build on your algorithm skills by learning more advanced algorithms such as brute-force greedy algorithms, graph algorithms, and dynamic programming which optimizes recursion by storing results to sub problems.

#### Route Planner (To be done)
* In this project, you will build a route-planning algorithm like the one used in Google Maps to calculate the shortest path between two points on a map. 
* You will first select and implement appropriate data-structure to represent points on a map and then implement A* algorithm to find shortest path.
