## Explanation 1
The efficiency of the algorith is O(log(n)), this is because within the while loop the divisor varible is increased and therefore
the result is reduced until the exit critrea is reached.

The interesting factor that I found with this problem, was that the divsor needed to be the same as the result. The result was returned
as an interger, this was the requirement of the problem.
