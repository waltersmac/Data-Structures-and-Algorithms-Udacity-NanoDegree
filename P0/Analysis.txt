Big O Notation for each task:

Task0
The code in the task was constant, therefore the worse case 'Big 0' Notation is: 'O(1)'

Task1
The code in the task has a for loop within a for loop, therefore the worse case 'Big 0' Notation is: 'O(n^2)' 

Task2
The code in the task has one for loop through the data, therefore the worse case 'Big 0' Notation is: 'O(n)'

Task3
Part A
The code in the task has one for loop through the data, therefore the worse case 'Big 0' Notation is: 'O(n)' 

Part B
The code in the task has one for loop through the data, therefore the worse case 'Big 0' Notation is: 'O(n)' 

Task4
The code in the task has one for loop through the data, therefore the worse case 'Big 0' Notation is: 'O(n)'
